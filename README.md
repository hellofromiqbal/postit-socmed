# POSTIT-SOCMED (Post It Social Media App)

This is a mini-social media app project.
I've built this app to learn deeper about CRUD concepts, React JS and Firebase at the same time.
In this app, we can create posts, read recent posts from every users, like/unlike posts, comment posts,
also delete posts/comments of our own.
No need to create an account to try this app. Just sign in with Google account and feel free to test this mini-app!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
